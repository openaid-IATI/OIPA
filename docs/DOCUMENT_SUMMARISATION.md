# Document summarisation in IATI.cloud
- [Introduction](#introduction)

## Introduction
IATI activities contain many, many document-links. This is an initial setup to prove that it is possible to extract the content from these documents, and include a summary of these documents. We apply the summary method from the Bert Extractive library. This process can be heavily improved with (paid) abstractive summarisation services that are able to process the data faster and provide better summaries.
