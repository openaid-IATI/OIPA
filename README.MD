OIPA extracts all published IATI XML files from the [IATI Registry](http://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher) and makes them available in a normalised PostgreSQL database, that you can access using a RESTful API.

IATI is a global aid transparency standard and it makes information about aid spending easier to access, re-use and understand the underlying data using a unified open standard. You can find more about the IATI XML standard at: <a href="http://www.iatistandard.org" target="_blank">www.iatistandard.org</a>


## Documentation
--------

Documentation on installing, running and using OIPA can be found at <a href="http://docs.oipa.nl" target="_blank">docs.oipa.nl</a>


## Quick start
-------

1. Go to your OIPA folder.
2. Run ```virtualenv <name> -p python3``` to install virtual environment in python3.
3. Run ```source env/bin/activate``` to activate the virtual environment.
4. Install required libraries using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Create a PostgreSQL database.
6. Set up the database specifications in the file ```OIPA/.env``` as follows:
   * OIPA_DB_NAME= ```<your database name>```
   * OIPA_DB_USER= ```<user name>```
   * OIPA_DB_PASSWORD= ```<password>```
7. Run ```python manage.py migrate``` to migrate tables to the newly created database.
8. Start the server: ```python manage.py runserver localhost:8000``` 
9. Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
10. Start the process control centre (supervisor): ```python manage.py supervisor```
11. Open your browser at <a href="http://localhost:8000" target="_blank">localhost:8000</a>
12. Follow instructions for sign-in: http://docs.oipa.nl/en/latest/admin_interface/
13. Finally, follow the instructions from here: http://docs.oipa.nl/en/latest/where_to_start/

Happy Hunting!

## Can I contribute?
--------

Yes please! We are mainly looking for coders to help on the project. If you are a coder feel free to *Fork* the repository and send us Pull requests!

## How should I contribute?
--------

Python already has clear <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank">PEP 8</a> code style guidelines, so it's difficult to add something to it, but there are certain key points to follow when contributing:

* <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank">PEP 8</a> code style guidelines should _always_ be followed
* When making commits, in the first line try to summarize changes (in around 50 characters or less) and in the message body (if needed) try to explain _what_ you did, and, most importantly, _why_. Try to avoid commit messages like "Moving to Python 3" or "Fixed bugs". Other developers should be able to understand _why_ the change was made!
* Always try to reference issues ("related to #614", "closes #619" and etc.)
* Avoid huge code commits where the difference can not even be rendered by browser based web apps (Github for example). Smaller commit make it much easier to understand why the change was made, why (if) it resulted in certain bugs and etc
* When developing new feature, write at least some basic tests for it. This helps not to break other things in the future
* If there's a reason to commit code that is commented out (there usually should be none), always leave a "FIXME" or "TODO" comment so it's clear for other developers _why_ this was done
* When using external dependencies that are not in PyPI (from Github for example), stick to a particular commit (i. e. `git+https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor@ec495be4e28c694af1e41514e08c03cf6f1496c8#egg=supervisor`), so if the library is updated, it doesn't break everything
* In the near future, automatic code quality / testing checks (continuous integration tools) will be implemented to check all these things automatically when pushing / merging new branches. Quality is the key!
* These rules are to be extended

## Running the tests
-------
To run the tests, log into the vagrant machine and run:

```./manage.py test --nomigrations --settings=OIPA.test_settings```
