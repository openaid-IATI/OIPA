# Installation scripts

In this directory, we provide installation scripts for the services we use.
These scripts are written for Ubuntu 20.04.

We have scripts available for the following services:
- Mongo (used for direct-indexing budget aggregations)

We need to introduce scripts for the requirements stated in the main README.md
